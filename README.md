# NodeRED-tool-flows
helpful miscellaneous and sundry flows I created over the years

File Driver - flow for capturing events to disk and/or replaying them to the IoT platfrom. 
              can be configured to use 1 message per file or 1 message per line in a single file
                            
IoTP Onboard - manage devicetype(s) and device CRUD operations via REST api

IoTP Subscription - basic flow to listen to all IoTP events. Flow can be copied/edited to listen to all platfrom message types 
                    events, commands, status, state, errors, and triggers.
                    
Rules_Actions - create event monitoring rules and actions via REST

ST numeric - change sensor tag fields from string to numeric

SensorTag1 - early sensor tag flow showing some basic Node-Red capability

SensorTag5 - flow to parse and publish a sensor tag event as 5 distinct sensors

Simulator - basic sumulator flow

UI demo - basic examples using the UI dashboard package
